/**
 * Implementation of {@link Scheduler} whose {@link CompletableFuture}s are shared for all occurrences of the same parameter value.
 * <p>
 * This implementation supports all features defined by {@link Scheduler}. However, recursive tasks can cause deadlocks if the dependency chain has a loop, and
 * large volumes of recursive tasks can quickly run the system out of memory or cause the worker threads' stacks to overflow. It is therefore recommended to use
 * {@link ApproximatelyPrioritizedSharedFutureScheduler} where possible.
